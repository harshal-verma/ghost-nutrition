        details: "Citrulline is one of the best pump ingredients on the market. Most brands elect to stick Citrulline in a proprietary blend, under dose the compound or use ‘Citrulline Malate,’ which today is no more than a blend of L-Citrulline and Malic Acid, often in an undisclosed ratio. In fact, the 4 grams of L-Citrulline per scoop in GHOST Legend® is equivalent to the L-Citrulline content of 8 grams of Citrulline Malate! Pure L-Citrulline may be more expensive, but anecdotally provides better pumps without the potential for stomach discomfort caused by the additional acid.",
